  ## ABSTRACT
This project is a Geospatial Mapping and Analysis System developed for a company to facilitate Geofencing, Territorial Mapping, and Enforcement while enabling data-driven decision-making at the district, Local Government Area (LGA), and state levels.

The system integrates interactive mapping using Flask, Folium, and GeoJSON datasets to visualize Nigeria's states, LGAs, and districts. Users can dynamically filter and explore different administrative boundaries, ensuring efficient resource allocation, boundary enforcement, and detailed geospatial data analysis.

## OBJECTIVES
- Geofencing: Defining and monitoring administrative boundaries.
- Territorial Mapping: Visualization of districts, LGAs, and states for strategic planning.
- Enforcement: Supporting regulatory compliance and jurisdictional enforcement.
- Data Analysis: Driving insights at different geographical levels to optimize decision-making.
